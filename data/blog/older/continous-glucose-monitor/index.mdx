## What?

A Continous Glucose Monitor is a small sensor that you place on your body, typically around your triceps, that will continously measure the glucose levels in your blood. It [works by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FecOjMsgMw) inserting a thin probe into your skin (not vessels), and measuring the glucose levels inside the intercellular fluid. The glucose reacts with the enzyme [glucose oxidase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_oxidase) and electrical current levels created by the subsequent reactions is measured as a proxy to the glucose levels. You can then transfer the measurements to a smartphone or a dedicated reading device.

## Why?

I've been reading and [listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzZUnl3b49U) a lot about the topics of nutrition, [aging](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Gifr7mhEsQBI5oGzJomz2), and longevity. A huge part of our health seems to be dependent on the sugar and fat metabolism, and the consequences of malfunctions of it such as [insulin resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqBkG0ZECn8), diabetes, and obesity. Sugar-insulin levels are the primary factors of the metabolism. A healthy sugar-insulin metabolism is key to a healthier and longer life.

I also have a significant family history of diabetes, nearly every single family member. It would be beneficial to know how sensitive I am.

Plus, I am curious how these magical devices work.

## The Experiment

I used Abott's [Freestyle Libre 2](https://www.freestylelibre.de/libre/produkte/freestylelibre2-sensor.html) as it was easily available where I live. There are other brands but most are similar. The sensor is about the size of a 2 thicker euro coin that snaps onto your body and sticks firmly. The process is extremely easy and without any pain. [Watch it here](https://youtu.be/DnQydBN_TLQ?t=90). It works for 14 days upon intialization.

The only thing to pay attention, to my experience, is the sensor lifts a little apart from the plaster. If that happens the sensor may catch surfaces and lift the sensor even more, eventually ejecting the sensor. This happened to me on the 13th day and the sensor stopped working. You should consider using[band-aids](https://www.blood-sugar-lounge.de/2016/03/die-zweite-woche-mit-dem-freestyle-libre-teil-2/), [overlay plasters](https://www.amazon.de/Fixierung-f%C3%BCr-Freestyle-Libre-Sensoren/dp/B087XVGXW3/) or [holder bands](https://www.ebay.de/itm/FLEXIBEL-Freestyle-Libre-1-2-Fixierband-Halter-Fixierung-Gitter-Weiss-/202797170852) if you're really serious.

## Results

Luckily, I seem to have fairly stable glucose levels. my glucose never peaked above 160 mg/dL or dipped dangerously. In the second week I tried snacking sweets but even that did not disrupt the levels too much.

I did short 16 hour [IF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting) periods. Often when breaking the fast the sugar levels quickly rise.

Also some 'healthy' foods are actually not that innocent. Like an oatmeal bowl with banana, honey, and milk skyrockets the glucose levels followed by a sudden dip. No wonder why you get hungry before the lunch.

I took note of what I've eaten during this period and annotated them on the graph. Although, I should've measured what I've eaten more precisely but it still gives some ideas.

My approach was fairly crude, so is my writing. I was inspired by these wonderful articles on CGIs.
