Hi!

I am Kaan Uzdoğan. I was born and raised in [Kayseri, Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayseri), studied in [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul) at [Istanbul Erkek High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_High_School) and [Boğaziçi University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C4%9Fazi%C3%A7i_University). I recently graduated from [Technical University of Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Munich) where I studied Informatik (Computer Science) Master's. I wrote my thesis on [Peer Review Verification with Verifiable Credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://github.com/kuzdogan/peer-review-verifiable-credentials-thesis).

I'm mostly a Javascript guy. I usually work with React, nodejs, and usual HTML & CSS. I have some Solidity experience and interested in blockchain technologies, especially the things around the Ethereum ecosystem.

Otherwise I enjoy [playlisting](https://open.spotify.com/user/11101586339), snowboarding, casually creating [Instagram filters](https://www.instagram.com/ar/807999473352418/), and cooking.
