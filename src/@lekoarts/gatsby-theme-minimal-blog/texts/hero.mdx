Hi

I'm Kaan. This is my place on the internet 🌎.

I'm a curious computer science grad and software developer from Turkey 🇹🇷, currently based in Berlin 🇩🇪. I am working on [Sourcify](https://twitter.com/sourcifyeth) at the Ethereum Foundation.

I write my thoughts, experiences, and some `technical stuff` here.

More [about me](/about).
